  <h2>Favorite Trip</h2>
  Last year, my family and I went to Italy and the UK on a two week trip with my wife, two daughters and myself. We
  started off in London and went to the normal sites -- Big Ben, Buckingham and Kensington Palaces, a few museums. From
  there, we flew to Milan and traveled around to several cities in Italy, including Rapallo, Lake Como and Courmayeur.

    <h2>Favorite Restaurant</h2>
    My favorite restaurant is <a href = "https://www.yelp.com/biz/emmas-ale-house-white-plains" target="_blank">Emma's</a> in White Plains, NY.
    They have pretty good food for an Irish pub, great service and my kids always get hot chocolate with whipped cream.

  <h2>Favorite Food</h2>

    Burritos are my favorite food as they're an entire meal served in a neat wrap which you can eat for any meal. My favorite breakfast burritos are simple with egg and cheese with a bit of hot sauce. For other times, my preferred Chipotle order is a vegetarian fajita burrito with black beans, mild salsa, red sauce, cheese and lettuce.

      <td>JD Salinger</td>
      <td><em>Catcher in the Rye</em> is a classic coming-of-age story about the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, who spends an eventful weekend in New York City away from his preporatory school. When I first read it in high school at a school similar to Holden's, I thought he was cool and the book, in part, inspired me to move to New York City. Reading it as an adult, however, offers a totally different experience in which Holden is more naive boy than adventurer.</td>

      <td>William Goetzmann </td>
      <td>As much as a historic accounting of currency throughout human history can be, <em>Money Changes Everything</em> is a page-turner that chronicles a fascinating account of how humans began to use different forms of currency (shells, precious metals, paper fiat, crypto, etc.) to denote value. <em>Money Changes Everything</em> starts with the early days of cavepeople and fast forwards to modern times highlighting the necessity of money and how it has helped create civilized society.  </td>

      <td>George Orwell</td>
      <td>Another classic, <em>1984</em>, provides a prescient view of near-future dystopian society in which citizens' activities are closely monitored my a centralized authority, language and history changed to engender thinking in support of the government and thoughts can be illegal. It remains incredibly relevant for modern day, especially in a formal professional role of working in data analytics for a public relations agency.</td>

      <td>Daniel Kahneman</td>
      <td>Kahneman, a celebrated psychologist for his work in behavioral economics, introduces a number of concepts that help explain how human beings make decisions, including System 1 vs System 2 thinking, framing and loss aversion, among others. As someone who works in data for marketing use cases, it's a very relevant read into why people buy the things they do.</td>
